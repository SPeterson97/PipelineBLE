# PipelineBLE

## Purpose
This project stemmed from the following research project: https://www.pittwire.pitt.edu/news/under-pressure-device-could-help-avoid-pipeline-disasters-aid-glaucoma-patients

PipelineBLE is designed to provide an interface into the hardware component via Bluetooth Low Energy. Some of the features include:

1. Communication via UART

2. Data streaming, presented dynamically on a line chart

3. Save data to be viewed and exported

4. Buttons to send similar commands repeatedly

## Credit
BLE implementation was inspired from: https://github.com/adafruit/Bluefruit_LE_Connect_v2
